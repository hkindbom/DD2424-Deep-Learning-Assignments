# DD2424-Deep-Learning-Assignments
The four assignments in the deep learning course on KTH spring 2020. Everything is implemented from scratch using Matlab.

### Assignment 1
Training and testing a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network is trained using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function, that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled
training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

### Assignment 2
Similar to assignment 1 but for a two layer network plus hyperparameteroptimization using random search on lambda as well as implementation of cyclical learning rates.

### Assignment 3

### Assignment 4
